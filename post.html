            <h1>The Decision</h1>
            <p>I think the most simple, and yet, the important decision an immigrant can make is to where they want to go, or specifically how will they achieve such a thing.
                With me and my husband was no different, we knew we needed to leave our country in order to succeed, and we needed to decide where should we go.
                There is always the American Dream right??!? WRONG!
                In our case me not working or studying wasn’t an option, and now I say this, but for our own good US doesn’t have a friendly immigration system. I would need to go on a spouse visa, or stay in Brazil until my husband could apply for his green card, and this never was appealing to us.
                Can you imagine staying on a place that don’t allow you to grow professionally? No right?! Same for us!
                In October 2017 we decided to move to Canada, but we needed to choose the city. We agreed we would study about the country, and the places we could see ourselves living happy, and making the immigration path easier.
                Weighting all the pros and cons about each city, we landed in Toronto. The most logical decision, due to Luan working in IT and the fact the city has amazing colleges.
                Our decision was that I was going to study, and Luan would work. This proved to be the best decision in our case. Luan landed a job in his second week living in Toronto, while we were living on airBnb, but I’ll tell this story later.
                We were so excited with our decision that we found a picture of Toronto, and hang it on out bedroom door for more than a year.</p>
